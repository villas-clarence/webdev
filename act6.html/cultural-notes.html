</html><h2>Travel tips & cultural notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Respect local customs — many Ivatan communities are conservative and welcoming. Ask before photographing people and private homes.</li>
<li>Bring cash — ATMs are limited (Basco has the main services).</li>
<li>Pack windproof clothing and comfortable shoes — wind and sudden weather changes are common.</li>
<li>Internet and cell signal may be limited; prepare for slower connectivity and bring offline maps if needed.</li>
<li>Accommodations range from simple homestays to small guesthouses. Book ahead during peak season.</li>
</ul>
