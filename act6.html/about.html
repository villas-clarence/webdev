    <h2>About Batanes</h2>
    <p>
      Batanes is an archipelago of small islands sitting between Luzon and Taiwan. It is famous for dramatic cliffs, vast open skies, and traditional Ivatan stone houses built to withstand frequent typhoons. Life in Batanes moves at a gentle pace â€” agriculture, fishing, and preservation of culture are central to daily life.

      Popular natural attractions include Vayang Rolling Hills, Marlboro Country (a gently rolling pasture on Batan Island), Basco Lighthouse, Valugan Boulder Beach, and the sea cliffs on Sabtang and Itbayat. The islands are also a prime spot for sunrise and sunset photography and quiet nature walks.
